<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am enthusiastic about reinforcement learning and its applications to real-life scenarios. I have in-depth knowledge of reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically in multi-objective reinforcement learning, machine learning algorithms at the edge, sustainable AI, brain-computer interfaces, remote health applications, and energy harvesting solutions utilizing run-time energy management algorithms.
